TODO:
	- Vector -> Add missing Vectormath (Scalar-Product, Positional-Relation, Vector/Vector-Angle)
	- Main.switchState() -> find a way to use Multithreading for initialization (tough nut)
	- Math2D -> Add Lines and Boxes
	- Easy Asset Inclusion?
	- Preloadable -> init() is static in Asset-class! How do I implement the Interface properly?
		-> Currently running Assets through an object, maybe put the Loading into a State
			-> Worked out! now the StartupState needs to switch to MenuState after Completion
